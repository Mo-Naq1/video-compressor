# Video Compressor

This is a video compressor. I made it in order to send clips through Discord. Most of my clips are normally ~40mb, and the limit for file sizes in Discord is 25mb. 
## Features

- Can compress multiple files in one click
- Can set target file size
- Deletes original files and places completed ones in a new folder 



To use it, create a folder in your desktop called "compressed_videos" 

Copy and paste the path to "compressed_videos" into the folder_path variable.

Create a folder within it called "finished"

Drag any mp4 videos to the compressed_videos folder and run the script.
